        <p><span onclick="pt1()">dear brin</span>,</p>

        <p>HAPPY <span onclick="pt2()">3RD YEAR</span> ANNIVERSARY!!!</p>
        <p>it's been a long time hasn't it? i feel like we've really changed, or maybe
            that's just <span onclick="pt3()">me</span> thinking that.
            but regardless, three years!!! it might seem like a little to you but to me it's crazy.
            have i ever told you, that you were my first online friend? i must have, not really sure if you
            remember it but you were.</p>

        <p>i'm <span onclick="pt4()">really glad</span> you were my first online friend.
            i might say this often but you have genuinely helped me in every aspect of my life n i genuinely <span
                onclick="pt5()">don't know
                where i'd be without you</span>. i feel like i don't text you enough, but i think that it'd probably be
            too
            <span onclick="pt6()">overwhemling</span> if i did. that or maybe i'd be bothering you
            a lot n i'd feel bad about it.
        </p>

        <p>
            sometimes, i feel like i don't do enough, or when i do "do enough", <span onclick="pt24()">it's not right, 
            good or it doesn't help in the slightest, yknow?</span> i worry sometimes, that when you come to me, i don't 
            say the right thing n i really hope that hasn't been the case - rather, i hope there hasn't been an issue 
            big enough that makes you needa come vent, yknow? i'm always here for you though, good advice or bad advice 
            notwithstanding.
        </p>

        <p>but away from all of that, i hope you've been good. i know things can get really stressful n
            eventually you might find it hard to keep going but just keep trying. <span onclick="pt7()">
            it will all get easier eventually, ups n downs n alla that</span>. i'm really proud of you too, i might
            not say
            it often but i am. you've come so, so far - you have a job, you finished <span onclick="pt8()">
            college</span>. this may not seem like much to you, but it's an accomplishment in it's own right - at
            least to me.
            you're a lot stronger than i am, most times anyways - or maybe we have the same strength level, i'm not
            really sure
            where im going with this.</p>

        <p>
            i don't know if i mention it <span onclick="pt28()">later</span>, but you've always been there when i 
            need you. like <span onclick="pt29()">today</span>, i'm complaining about being sick n feeling horrible 
            about it n you turn up n talk. even if it was for a short amount of time - do you know how happy i was 
            to hear from you? i really, really <span onclick="pt30()">was</span>. it's always nice to hear from you, n 
            i'm glad that i know you'll always appear if i text you about something semi-serious.
        </p>

        <p>i think, that there are times where i miss <span onclick="pt9()">"the old times"</span>
            where we'd text every day n there wouldn't be a day where i wouldn't get a text from you. i miss them, n i
            say this
            <span onclick="pt10()">looking back</span> on it n knowing that we change n get busy
            n alla that. i think what i'm trying to say with this is that i miss you n i miss talking to you. i still
            have
            <span onclick="pt11()">twitter notifications</span> on for you, i kinda use
            them as a way of knowing you're okay LMFAOOO. 'oh, brin reposted this, she's okay i'm glad', something like
            that. genuinely, please do not feel like you have to respond to me, i think i've said this enough but i'd
            be glad to see the twitter notifications n know immediately that you're alive n well.
        </p>

        <p>
            yknow, whenever i'll see the color pink, or a sunflower, or hell, even demon slayer/hi3 - i'll think of 
            you. i know i already send you pictures of sunflowers, but i don't see them often, n when i do, i just 
            think 'wow, brin would like this, <span onclick="pt25()">lemme send it to her</span>'. i don't know if you 
            find it annoying but considering the distance, i think it's nice to see <span onclick="pt26()"> signs 
            of you </span> everywhere. to <span onclick="pt27()">add onto this</span>, sometimes, someone will use
            ":0" n i'll think of you. it's something so small but it makes me happy to see.
        </p>

        <p>
            it's been such a long time since you've written yknow, at least to me it feels
            that way. yknow, i looked at your <span onclick="pt36()">account today</span> n i remember reading your fics n 
            just being floored by how good they were. ynever posted your themis/wol fic, did you ever finish it? maybe i've
            forgotten, i'm sorry :{
        </p>

        <p>
            yknow, that day we watched flow n 101 dalmatians together, i had a really <span onclick="pt37()">fun time</span>. 
            i'm sorry if i came across as pushy, i just wanted to spend some <span onclick="pt38()">more time</span> with you.
            i wonder if you remember watching both, i might, <span onclick="pt39()">though i'm not sure</span>. i hope we can spend more 
            time together, doing stuff like this was really fun.
        </p>

        <p>a lot has changed in my life, at least recently, n i'm very, very happy that you can be here with me for it.
            changes for the better, for the most part, but having you around despite every change is something i will
            never
            take for granted. i don't think i'll ever forget meeting you through
            <span onclick="pt12()">fanfic</span> of all things; i'm glad it did happen,
            regardless of how.
        </p>

        <p>i hope you know i love you a lot. that i will forever love you, even if we - god forbid -
            <span onclick="pt13()">drift apart</span>.
            i hope you know that you can always come to me, regardless of
            <span onclick="pt14()">time or situation</span>.
            no matter what, i will <span onclick="pt15()">always</span>
            be here for you n that will never change, you have <span onclick="pt16()">my word</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            i'm sorry a lot of these devolved into me just talking about, like, random shit <span onclick="pt31()">
            half the time</span>. you get enough of me talking n talking, but i think maybe this is <span onclick="pt32()">
            easier to read n go through</span>? n like i said, i hope it's a good enough gift <span onclick="pt33()">
            considering everything</span>. when i'm writing this, i tried to get you to give me some of your <span onclick="pt34()">
            favourite songs</span> but you didn't <span onclick="pt35()">respond</span>!!!
        </p>

        <p>
            i hope this was a good present honestly - i feel like a whole letter on discord would've been too much -
            so i thought this would be the <span onclick="pt17()">next best thing</span>.
            you could definitely make something much better, considering you
            <span onclick="pt18()">properly studied</span> webdev while i just half-assed all of it LMFAOO. i'm sorry
            that i won't be with you properly, at least not anytime soon, n i'm sorry this is all i can <span
                onclick="pt19()">offer</span>.
            i really, really hope this can convey even the smallest amount of affection i hold for you.
            you will forever be <span onclick="pt20()">my bestie</span> n that will <span onclick="pt21()">never
                change</span>.
            i appreciate n love you for <span onclick="pt22()">everything you've ever done</span>.
        </p>

        <p>/hug mwah mwah i love you <span onclick="pt23()"><£</span>!!</p>
